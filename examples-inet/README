MiXiM - INET examples

This folder contains examples that show how to use lower layer MiXiM modules 
(i.e. wireless NICs) in INET Framework. 

To use MiXiM with INET:
- Download and extract INET-Framework 2.1+ into the same workspace where 
  the MiXiM project is installed (it must be the sibling of 'mixim'.)
- Import INET into the workspace (if you are using the IDE) 
  (File | Import... | Existing Projects into the Workspace)
- Build INET

If you are using the IDE:
- Open Project Properties on the 'mixim' project.
- On the OMNeT++ / Project Features page disable the 'MiXiM Standalone' feature.
- On the OMNeT++ / NED Source Folders page select 'examples-inet' as a NED folder and
  deselect the 'src/inet_stub' folder.
- On the Project References page select 'inet' as a referred project.
- Build the 'mixim' project, too.

If you are building from command line:
- Create makefiles that link with the INET and the build mixim:
  $ make makefiles-using-inet
  $ make

Once the project was successfully built, go to the 'examples-inet' folder and try
out the examples:
- IDE: Right click on an 'omnetpp.ini' file and select 'Run As.. / OMNeT++ Simulation'.
- Command line: use the provided 'run' scripts in the example directories.
