Network for testing a hybrid host (hybridRouter) containing different wired
(from INET) and wireless (from MiXiM) NICs.

This network contains several hosts, each equipped with a different type of
NIC, in particular ethernet, 802.11 and 802.15.4 (TI_CC2420).

Further the network contains the hybridRouter which is equipped with
all of these types of NICs. Thus the hybridRouter is capable of establishing a
connection to every host in the network as well as route packages between
hosts.

All hosts which are not the router are equipped with a PING-application. The
several configurations demonstrate the sending of PINGs between the different
hosts, routed by the hybridRouter.

Note: NICs connected by different ConnectionManagers (here: 802.11 and
      802.15.4) cannot interfere with each other yet.
