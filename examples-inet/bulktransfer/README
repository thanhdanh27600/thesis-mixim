This network is based on INET's "inet/bulktransfer" example.
It is used to show a simple INET network with a host exchanging data over TCP
using a MiXiM 802.11 network interface card.

IP addresses and default routes are set up automatically, using 
FlatNetworkConfigurator. Note: FlatNetworkConfigurator does only work with MiXiM
wireless NICs if default routes for every host are sufficient. This means hosts
may not have more than one NIC and no routing is necessary.

The network consists of three clients and one server. All three clients exchange
data with the server.
The application models bulk file transfer.
