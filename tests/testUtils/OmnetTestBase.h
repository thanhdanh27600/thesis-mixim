/**
 * @brief Utility class to ease testing of OMNeT++ modules.
 *
 * Since most OMNeT++ modules need a network to be executed this module provides
 * a simple base module to ease generation of that network as well providing
 * some entry-points to execute simple UnitTests in (without having to care
 * initialize() or handleMessage().
 *
 * Tests should subclass this module. The tests cases should be executed by
 * implementing them in the "runTests()" method which is executed by
 * SimpleTest during initialisation.
 * After all tests have been executed the member "testsExecuted" should be set
 * to true. SimpleTest checks this member during "finish()" to make sure
 * that the tests have been actually executed.
 *
 * SimpleTest further provides a mechanism to plan test cases. This can be
 * useful for the following reasons:
 * - planning tests forces the author to pre-think about the cases which should
 * be covered by a test without getting distracted by actually implementing them
 * yet
 * - enumerating planned tests serves for documentation purposes so one can
 * easily see which cases are covered by the test
 * - by planning the test cases with SimpleTest it can automatically make
 * sure that every planned test is actually executed and implemented
 *
 * To plan tests using SimpleTest one can override the "planTests()" method
 * where one can then enumerate every tests case using the "planTest()" method.
 * To execute a previously planned test case one simply uses "testForX()"
 * methods instead of "assertX()". E.g. "testForTrue()" instead of
 * "assertTrue()" or "testForEqual()" instead of "assertEqual()".
