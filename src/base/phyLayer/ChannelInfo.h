/**
 * @brief This class is used by the BasePhyLayer to keep track of the AirFrames
 * on the channel.
 *
 * ChannelInfo is able to return every AirFrame which intersects with a
 * specified interval. This is mainly used to get the noise for a received
 * signal.
 *
 * ChannelInfo is a passive class meaning the user has to tell it when a new
 * AirFrame starts and an existing ends.
 *
 * Once an AirFrame has been added to the ChannelInfo the ChannelInfo holds the
 * ownership of this AirFrame even if the AirFrame is removed again from the
 * ChannelInfo. This is necessary because the ChannelInfo has to be able to
 * store also the AirFrames which are over but still intersect with an currently
 * running AirFrame.
 *
 * Note: ChannelInfo assumes that the AirFrames are added and removed
 * 		 chronologically. This means every time you add an AirFrame with a
 * 		 specific start time ChannelInfo assumes that start time as the current
 * 		 time and assumes that every following action happens after that moment.
 * 		 The same goes for "removeAirFrame". When removing an AirFrames,
 * 		 ChannelInfo assumes the start time plus the duration of the AirFrame as
 * 		 the current time.
 * 		 This also affects "getAirFrames" in the way that you may only ask for
 * 		 intervals which lie before the "current time" of ChannelInfo.
 *
 * A state-machine-diagram for Radio, RadioStateAnalogueModel and ChannelInfo
 * showing how they work together under control of BasePhyLayer as well as some
 * documentation on how RadioStateAnalogueModel works is available
 * in @ref phyLayer.
