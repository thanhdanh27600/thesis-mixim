 * @brief Provides some base functionality for most common deciders.
 *
 * Forwards the AirFrame from "processSignal" to "processNewSignal",
 * "processSignalHeader" or "processSignalEnd" depending on the
 * state for that AirFrame returned by "getSignalState".
 *
 * Provides answering of ChannelSenseRequests (instantaneous and over time).
 *
 * Subclasses should define when they consider the channel as idle by
 * calling "setChannelIdleStatus" because BaseDecider uses that to
 * answer ChannelSenseRequests.
 *
 * If a subclassing Decider only tries to receive one signal at a time
 * it can use BaseDeciders "currentSignal" member which is a pair of
 * the signal to receive and the state for that signal. The state
 * is then used by BaseDeciders "getSignalState" to decide to which
 * "process***" method to forward the signal.
 * If a subclassing Decider needs states for more than one Signal it
 * has to store these states by itself and should probably override
 * the "getSignalState" method.
