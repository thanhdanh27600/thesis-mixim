 * \image html BasePhyLayer.png "BasePhyLayer class graph"
 *
 * The BasePhyLayer class itself serves more or less only as container
 * and glue between several subclasses. They can be described well by their
 * task during the receiving process of an AirFrame:
 *
 * \image html RecvDetails.png "Receiving process details"
 *
 * On reception of an new AirFrame BasePhyLayer registers it at first with
 * its ChannelInfo member which keeps track of all currently active AirFrames on
 * the channel.
 *
 * Then the signal contained in the AirFrame is handed to every AnalogueModel
 * member of this phy layer. They calculate and add the attenuation effect of
 * the channel on the signal during its transmission.
 * A special AnalogueModel which every phy layer has is the AnalogueModel of the
 * Radio member. It simulates the effect of the state of the radio (SLEEP, RX, TX) on
 * the signal by defining an attenuation of 0% for the time the Radio is
 * receiving and 100% for the other times (which means the signal couldn't be
 * received at all).
 *
 * After that the AirFrame is handed the first time to the Decider which has
 * to decide if the AirFrame can and should be received or not. It also has to decide
 * if the Signal was received correctly or if there where errors. To do this
 * it can tell the phy layer to hand the AirFrame to it at arbitrary other
 * points in time during the transmission.
 * The Decider also has to tell the phy layer when a received packet should
 * be sent up to the upper layer.
 *
 * At the end of the transmission BasePhyLayer tells ChannelInfo that the
 * AirFrame has ended.
 *
 * \image html RadioStatemachine.png "Behaviour and cooperation of Radio, RadioStateAnalogueModel and ChannelInfo under control of BasePhyLayer"
 *
 * The statemachine-diagram above gives an overview on how Radio,
 * RadioStateAnalogueModel (RSAM) and ChannelInfo work together under control
 * of BasePhyLayer.
 *
 * NOTE: (Global) events in the diagram are denoted in the form "module.event",
 * thus they only affect the particular module and are easier to find. Inside a module, an event is
 * denoted without this prefix "module.". The term "module" is used here not in the
 * sense of an OMNeT-module.
 * The events "BasePhyLayer.AirFrame started", "BasePhyLayer.AirFrame ended"
 * and "BasePhyLayer.E1" come from outside.
 *
 * On the functionality of the RadioStateAnalogueModel (RSAM):
 * RSAM is a passive database/entity module controlled and updated by BasePhyLayer according to the state
 * of the radio and the channel. RSAM filters incoming Signals
 * by adding an attenuation-mapping corresponding to radio-states and therefore tracks
 * information about the radio-state over time.
 *
 * Since this stored information may not be needed for all time in the past,
 * information that becomes obsolete can be discarded in RSAM by the CLEANUP-mechanism
 * (blue transitions).
 * Tracking of radio-states is switched on and off when the channel (see ChannelInfo states) becomes empty (tracking off,
 * green transition) or becomes not empty (tracking on, red transition).

/**
 * @defgroup mobility mobility - modules handling the mobility of the hosts
 *
 * The following diagrams give an overview of the functionality of a mobility-module.
 *
 * \image html Mobility.png "Activity diagram: an overview on how movement-updates in MobilityBase work"
 *
 * \image html makeMove.png "Sequence diagram: call-hierarchy when move-message is processed"
 *
 * Shows how sub-classing mobility-modules are involved in the movement-calculation for a host.
 * They overwrite the method makeMove() to calculate the next movement-step and after that
 * they have to call fixIfHostGetsOutside() which takes care of border-handling. The implementation
 * of this method at least has to call handleIfOutside() and pass the border-policy to use
 * as well as references to parameters to be updated.
 * The figure below shows some details on how border-handling and the different border-policies
 * work.

/**

 *
 * IMobility is responsible for position and movement of a host.
 *
 * BaseConnectionManager is responsible for keeping track of the hosts which are
 * in range of every other host.

 * At last BasePhyLayer uses the ConnectionManagerAccess interface provided by BaseConnectionManager

/**
 * @defgroup connectionManager connectionManager - channel and connection related classes
 * @ingroup base
 *
 * BaseConnectionManager keeps track of the hosts (or better NICs) in range of another host
 * (or better NIC). This information is needed by the BasePhyLayer when it sends an AirFrame to
 * the channel.
 * To get this information BasePhyLayer subclasses from ConnectionManagerAccess.
 *
 * ConnectionManagerAccess provides access for BasePhyLayer to BaseConnectionManager and provides
 * the current position of a NIC for BaseConnectionManager.
 *
 * BaseConnectionManager itself keeps a list of NicEntry objects for every NIC in the simulation.
 * The NicEntry further has a pointer to its NIC as well as a list of pointers to the NicEntries
 * of the NICs which are in range of this NicEntries NIC.
 *
 * The information of NICs in range of each other is updated by BaseConnectionManager every time a host
 * moves.
 *
 * ConnectionManager subclasses from BaseConenctionManager and decides if two NICs are in range of
 * each other by calculating the maximum transmission distance given a certain sensitivity,
 * transmission power and a number of path loss coefficients.

/**
 * @defgroup mapping mapping - classes representing mathematical mappings
 *
 * The following class graph shows an overview of the most important classes used by Mappings.
 *
 * \image html MappingDetail.png
 *
 * There a two types of mapping interfaces, ConstMapping and Mapping. ConstMapping can represent any
 * mathematical mapping but the the course of the mapping can't be set or changed arbitrary.
 * This interface is meant to be used for implementations which define the course of the
 * mapping by a concrete formula.
 * The Mapping interface extends the ConstMapping interface by a setValue() method
 * which can set and change the course of the represented mapping arbitrary. This interface is meant
 * to be used for generic mapping implementations which uses methods like interpolation to be able
 * to represent any arbitrary course of a mapping.
 *
 * Every ConstMapping (and therefore every Mapping) has a DimensionSet member which defines the domain
 * of the represented mapping. The DimensionSet class itself is an actual set of Dimension objects.
 * Each Dimension object represents a certain dimension like time or frequency.
 *
 * Further ConstMapping and Mapping define their own Iterator interfaces ConstMappingIterator and
 * MappingIterator which define the interface for iterators over a mapping implementation.
 *
 * The last important class is the Argument. It defines a position in a mappings domain by
 * mapping a number of Dimensions to the value inside that Dimension.

/**
 * @defgroup power Power consumption - Classes using/defining power consumption
 *
 * \image html power.png "Classes handling power consumption and host state"
 *
 * Every BaseModule automatically receives HostState changes by the signaling mechanism.
 * BaseModule itself raises an error inside "handleHostState()"
 * method if the hosts state changes to something else then active. This means every
 * host module (which derives from BaseModule) has to override this method if it wants
 * to work with host states other then active (like sleep, or off).
 *
 * BaseBattery defines the methods every battery module (or power source) has to implement
 * for tracking power consumption.
 * MiximBatteryAccess provides for every host module access to the battery (/power source)
 * by providing methods for registration with and drawing power from the battery.
 *
 * SimpleBattery is a simple implementation of a battery module.
 * PhyLayerBattery and BurstApplicationLayerBattery are only two examples for
 * host modules which support power consumption and host state changes.
