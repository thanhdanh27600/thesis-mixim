/**
 * @brief Implementation of L-MAC (Lightweight Medium Access Protocol for
 * Wireless Sensor Networks [van Hoesel 04] ).
 *
 * Each node has its own unique timeslot. Nodes can use their timeslots to
 * transfer data without having to contend for the medium or having to deal
 * with energy wasting collisions or retransmissions.
 *
 * During the first 5 full frames nodes will be waking up every controlDuration
 * to setup the network first by assigning a different timeslot to each node.
 * Normal packets will be queued, but will be send only after the setup phase.
 *
 * During its timeslot a node wakes up, checks the channel for a short random
 * period (CCA) to check for possible collision in the slot and, if the
 * channel is free, sends a control packet. If there is a collision it tries
 * to change its timeslot to an empty one. After the transmission of the control
 * packet it checks its packet queue and if its non-empty it sends a data
 * packet.
 *
 * During a foreign timeslot a node wakes up, checks the channel for
 * 2*controlDuration period for an incoming control packet and if there in
 * nothing it goes back to sleep and conserves energy for the rest of the
 * timeslot. If it receives a control packet addressed for itself it stays awake
 * for the rest of the timeslot to receive the incoming data packet.
 *
 * The finite state machine of the protocol is given in the below figure:
 *

 *
 * A paper describing the protocol is:
 *
 * L. van Hoesel and P. Havinga. A lightweight medium access
 * protocol (LMAC) for wireless sensor networks. In Proceedings of the 3rd
 * International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN),
 * pages 55-60, Berkeley, CA, February 2004. April.
