/**
 * @brief Extends PhyLayer by adding power consumption for tx, rx and idle.
 *
 * Does two things, first before sending messages to the channel or
 * receiving messages from the channel it checks the hosts current state.
 * If the host is not able to send or the receive (e.g. no power) the
 * messages are dropped.
 *
 * Further it draws a current depending on the current radio state.
 * For this it captures every call to "setRadioState()" and changes
 * the current to previously set default values according to the
 * new radios state. There are different currents for TX, RX, SLEEP
 * and SWITCHING state.
 * Its also possible to override "calcTXCurrentForPacket()" to
 * calculate the current used during TX depending on the actual
 * TX power instead of using the default value.
 *
 * Does also provide battery access to the Decider by implementing
 * DeciderToPhyInterfaces "drawCurrent()"-method. Using this method
 * the Decider can define a current delta which is applied to the RX
 * current during this radio state. This is meant to be used if the
 * Decider wants to define different currents for "listening" and
 * "decoding" phases in RX state.
 *
 * Defines initialization for "Decider80211Battery".
