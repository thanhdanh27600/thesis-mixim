/**
 * @brief Decider implementation which decides a signals
 * correctness by checking its SNR against a threshold.
 *
 * SNRThresholdDecider decides the channel state (idle/busy) at hand of the current
 * received total power level (independent from signal or noise).
 * If its above the threshold defined by the "busyThreshold" parameter
 * it considers the channel busy.
 * The RSSI value returned by this Decider for a ChannelSenseRequest
 * over time is always the RSSI value at the end of the sense.
 *
 * SNRThresholdDecider implements only instantaneous channel sensing
 * therefore it can only handle "UNTIL_IDLE" and "UNTIL_BUSY"
 * ChannelSenseRequests but not "UNTIL_TIMEOUT".
 *
 * Instantaneous channel sensing means SNRThresholdDecider is simplified in the way that
 * the channel does not has to be below the threshold for a certain
 * amount of time to be considered idle (how it would be in reality),
 * but immediately after the RSSI drops below the threshold the channel
 * is considered idle. This means "UNTIL_IDLE" and "UNTIL_BUSY" request
 * are also answered at the first moment the channel drops below or raises
 * above the threshold.
 * SNRThresholdDecider does not support "UNTIL_TIMEOUT" requests because
 * they are used to calculate the channel state over a time period
 * (by averaging over it for example) which is not consistent with using
 * instantaneous idle/busy changes.
