2012-06-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	- InterfaceEntry constructor changed: Now it stores a pointer to related 
	  interface module

	- InterfaceTable uses the stored interfaceModule ptr in InterfaceEntry instead
	  of taking it as a parameter
	  
	- modified gate/connection validation in InterfaceTable

	- bugfix: cGate::getDisplayString() has a side effect by creating an
	  empty channel when there was no channel attached to the gate previously.
	  solution: if no channel is connected to the gate do not call the getDisplayString()
	  method at all.

	Added getInterfaceByInterfaceModule(cModule*) method to InterfaceTable.
	It returns the InterfaceEntry* that belongs to the interface
	containing the specified module.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-03-04  Levente Meszaros

   Added "displayAddresses" parameter to InterfaceTable. Setting it to true
   will display all IP addresses on the connected links.

2012-02-14  Tamas Borbely

	Added getFirstMulticastInterface() to the InterfaceTable

	InterfaceTable: added getHostModule() method

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

2011-09-16  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for bug #137: order of modules in ned leads to segfault in
	inet-EtherMacBase/InterfaceTable

	I added a test for InterfaceTable::addInterface() function
	for checking initialization of 'nb' member. When 'nb' is NULL, the
	InterfaceTable not yet initialized ('nb' setted in stage 0).

	IPv6 comment

2011-09-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	bug #347: fixes some compiler warnings.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixing IPv6Address test

	also some include optimisation

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-10  Rudolf Hornig

	Moved NAMTrace and NAMTraceWriter to the obsolete directory.

	Features: add more features

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	features: add *_examples features, add SCTP feature

	correcting some #include, etc

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	features: TCP_NSC, TCP_lwip, IPv6 completed

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	change opp_error to throw cRuntimeError

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Dropped EmptyHook. Nop is used instead.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

	typos

	indent changes - from Thomas Reschka

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-07-07  Andras Varga

	* introduced IInterfaceTable, to allow users implement their own
	InterfaceTables and plug them into INET simulations, without any
	change to the base INET.

2008-07-01  Andras Varga

	* created this package, by moving files from contract/

	* InterfaceEntry: setter methods made virtual. This has near zero
	performance cost (calls to setters are rare, and the class already
	has a vptr due to cObject). Also added backpointer to containing
	InterfaceTable.

	* InterfaceTable: implemented NotificationBoard-based notifications
	about interface changes: NF_INTERFACE_CREATED, NF_INTERFACE_DELETED,
	NF_INTERFACE_STATE_CHANGED, NF_INTERFACE_CONFIG_CHANGED.
	The detail object for all four are the InterfaceEntry.

	* InterfaceTable: created a getInterfaceById() method, NOT to be
	confused with getInterface(pos)! Ids are stable after deletions,
	unlike 0..getNumInterfaces()-1 indices

	See contract/ChangeLog for earlier history of this code.
