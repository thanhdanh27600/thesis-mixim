This example shows how to use multiple ConnectionManagers in your simulation. 

The network contains two independent ConnectionManagers: "ISMChannel" and "GSMChannel".
There also is its own list of hosts for each channel "ISMNode" and "GSMNode".
Both types of hosts use BurstApplLayer <-> BaseNetwLayer <-> CSMAMacLayer <-> 
PhyLayer as network stack. Whereas the PhyLayer uses "SimplePathlossModel" 
as AnalogueModel and "SNRThresholdDecider" as Decider.

The channel a host uses is defined in its NICs "connectionManagerName" parameter.

Since the settings for the SimplePathlossModel differ for the GSM- and ISM-Nodes
there are two seperate <config>.xml for them (GSMmodels.xml and ISMmodels.xml).

The omnetpp.ini contains the following run configurations:

Config1 - Three hosts which use the same ConnectionManager. No propagation delay.
Config2 - Same as Config1 but with propagation delay.
Config3 - Two hosts using the GSMChannel ConnectionManager and two host using
		  the ISMChannel ConnectionManager. No propagation delay.
Config4 - Same as Config3 but with propagation delay.
General - Same as Config3
