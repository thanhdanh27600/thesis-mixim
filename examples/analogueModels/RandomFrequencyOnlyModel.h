 * @brief Sample implementation of an AnalogueModel which uses
 * MultiDimMapping as AttenuationMapping.
 *
 * This class is a sample which shows how to use the default Mapping implementation
 * to implement a signal attenuation over only one dimension but which is not the time.
 * Since every Mapping has to be defined in time we can't really create a Mapping
 * with only frequency as Dimension. But we can just create a two dimensional
 * Mapping over frequency and time which is constant in time space. This means
 * every time we want to set a value of the Mapping we will just pass 0 as parameter
 * for the time dimension.
