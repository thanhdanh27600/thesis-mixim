This example shows how to use MiXiMs 802.11 protocol implementation. 

The network consists of ten hosts broadcasting bursts of three packets
to the other hosts. When a broadcast is received a reply is sent back 
to the sender.

The hosts use "Mac80211" as MAC layer and their phy layer uses 
"SimplePathlossModel" as AnalogueModel and "Decider80211" as Decider.
Note that Mac80211 and Decider80211 are always meant to be used
together.

The default configuration in omnetpp.ini uses no propagation delay.
