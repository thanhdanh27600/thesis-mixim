This example shows the basic structure of a network using MiXiM.

The network consists of three hosts which use the CSMAMacLayer as MAC layer,
"SimplePathlossModel" as only AnalogueModel and a SNRThresholdDecider as
Decider.

The used Network- and Application layer can be defined in the omnetpp.ini. By
default the BaseNetwLayer and BurstApplLayer are used.

You can use this network as a template for your own simulation.
